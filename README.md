# Vowel Chart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/schweinebauch-heroes/vowelchart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/schweinebauch-heroes/vowelchart)

## Ideas

The user can insert a series of single points (single vowels) or glides.

The vowels can be long or not

Rounded vowels are marked with a different color, or maybe circled. And/or unrounded vowels appear to the left of a mark, and rounded vowels appear to the right of it.

The points for vowels or glides may be tagged with the default IPA symbol, or with a custom tag.

The a state of the diagram must be sharable e.g. any parameters should appear as URL parameters.
